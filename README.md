### Hi, you found me. ğŸ‘‹
## I'm TomÃ¡s, a CompSci Student.

I haven't done anything remarkable so far, but I've been a volunteer at [CPU_UC](https://www.instagram.com/cpu_uc/) for a while now, where I've learned to work around old hardware's limitations, the beauty of lightweight Linux distros and how a burnt power supply smells like.

Stuff I (somewhat) know how to work with:

 - Python 3 ğŸ’–
 - C ğŸ’”
 - Haskell ğŸ˜…
 - Ruby ğŸ˜’
