### Hi, you found me. 👋
## I'm Tomás, a CompSci Student.

I havne't done anything remarkable so far, but I've been a volunteer at [CPU_UC](https://www.instagram.com/cpu_uc/) for a while now, where I've learened to work around old hardware's limitations, the beauty of lightweight Linux distros and how a burnt power supply smells like.

Stuff I've learned to work with:

    - Python 💖
    - C 💢
    - Haskell 😅
