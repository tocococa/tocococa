### Hi, you found me. 👋
## I'm Tomás, a CompSci Student.

I haven't done anything remarkable so far, but I've been a volunteer at [CPU_UC](https://www.instagram.com/cpu_uc/) for a while now, where I've learned to work around old hardware's limitations, the beauty of lightweight Linux distros and how a burnt power supply smells like.

I've also been a TA in [IIC2343 Arquitectura de Computadores](https://github.com/IIC2343)(2021-1,2) and [IIC2233 Programación Avanzada](https://github.com/IIC2233)(2020-2 & 2021-2).

Currently working with ROS Gazebo for the simulation team at RoBote-X, so we can hopefully win the Maritime RobotX Challenge in 2022.

Stuff I (somewhat) know how to work with:

 - Python 3 🙄
 - C 💖
 - C++ 🤖 
 - Haskell 😅
 - RISC-V ASM 😐
 - Ruby 😒

You can('t) reach me [here](https://tocococa.github.io/)
